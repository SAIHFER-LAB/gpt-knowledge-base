    <p><strong>The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) </strong></p><p><strong>Core Components of HFACS</strong></p><p><strong>I. UNSAFE ACTS: </strong>This level refers to an individual&#x27;s actions that deviate from a generally recognized method of performing a task. Ultimately, it is these unsafe acts that increase the likelihood of an adverse event occurring. Stated more simply, unsafe acts are those things that people do or don’t do, that increase the risk of something bad happening. They consist of (1) Errors - Decision, Skill-based, and Perceptual and (2) Violations - Routine and Exceptional</p><p><strong>1.</strong><strong>ERRORS</strong> - Errors refer to activities that occur within the prescribed norms of a given situation, yet the actions do not achieve the intended outcome. More plainly, errors are instances where an individual is attempting to do the right thing, but actually does the wrong thing instead. Or, when someone chooses to do the right thing, but ends up doing it the wrong way. In either case, the person’s intention is to perform the task the way it is supposed to be done, but it simply does not work out. As a result, we say that they’ve made an error. </p><p><strong>Decision Errors (DE):</strong> These so-called thinking errors, represent the conscious actions, or inaction by individuals whose hearts are in the right place, yet the plan itself proves inadequate or inappropriate for the situation. As a result, the outcome is typically less than what we hoped for. Typically, these decision errors can take the form of inadequate information gathering, poor situation assessment, or inadequate response selection. (Note that decisions regarding taking excessive risks, pushing the envelope, or working around rules, are a unique type of decision issue in HFACS, called violations. These do not belong to the category of Decision Errors. Rather, the belong elsewhere in under violations, which are discussed later.)</p><p><strong>Skill-based</strong><strong>Error (SBE):</strong> In contrast to decision errors, skill-based errors occur during tasks that we perform without much conscious thought. They are often due to attention and memory failures, or  technique issues. Ultimately, these errors can take on many forms, such as incorrect or omitted actions, or applying improper technique.</p><p><strong>Perceptual Errors</strong><strong>(PE): </strong>The third type of errors, perceptual errors, occur within the context of our five primary sensory systems. As humans, we rely heavily on our visual and auditory senses to perceive our environment. Even our senses of smell, touch, and taste are used all the time. Frankly, it&#x27;s hard to imagine life without our perceptual senses. Yet, as sophisticated as our sensory systems are, they are not infallible.</p><p>For example, It&#x27;s well known that humans do not do well at tasks that require us to judge the movement or speed of objects, even if that object is ourself. That’s why we have speedometers in our automobiles, and explains why pilots have airspeed indicators in the cockpit. We&#x27;re also not very good at performing tasks that require us to judge heights and distances. That&#x27;s why we now have sensors and cameras in our cars, and why airplanes have altitude indicators. It also explains why pilots rely on ramp personnel to guide them to their gate.</p><p>As pervasive as perceptual errors are in normal environmental conditions, these errors occur more frequently in situations where sensory information is degraded, such as in the dark or in noisy environments. For example, it is hard to perceive text and read in a dark environment, so people may misperceive the letters.  However, perceptual errors also commonly occur when people have strong expectations about what they are seeing, hearing, touching, etc. This why it is hard for people to proof read their own writing. Their expectations about what words should be on the paper, makes them see those words. They therefore do not notice misspelled words, because of these expectations. They &quot;see what they expect to see&quot; or &quot;hear what they expect to hear.&quot; Finally, when the sensitivity of one’s sensory system is limited, because of hearing loss,  or reduced visual acuity, both types of perceptual errors are also more likely to occur.  </p><p><strong>I. UNSAFE ACTS continued...</strong></p><p><strong>2. VIOLATIONS</strong> - Unlike errors, which occur while a person is trying to perform an activity within the prescribe means of doing it, violations involve the willful disregard of the policies and procedures for performing a task.  They are a special time of decision making activity that involves the deliberate working around the rules, pushing the rules to the edge, taking excessive risks. In other words, violations occur within the context in which a person knows the required way of performing a task, but chooses or decides to do it &quot;their own way.&quot;</p><p>Presumably, violations occur because a person believes it is a better way to get the job done.  Not because they believe it is unsafe or will cause an accident. To be clear, we are not talking about sabotage, in which a person willfully causes harm. Rather, violations are often seen by the individual as a way to make a task easier or quicker to perform. They are often motivation driven, to optimize personal or organizational productively or gain. Unfortunately, such deviations from protocol, often increase the risk of harm, and in some cases, can cause accidents.</p><p><strong>Routine Violations (RV):</strong> Some instances, violations may represent a deeper type of behavior called routine violations. These routine violations tend to habitual or common behavior of an individual, are generally the norm within a work unit, and are often tolerated or overlooked by supervisors or managers. Note that the repetitive nature is not what makes routine violations, violations. Errors can be repetitive too, such as a doctor who repeatedly misdiagnosis an illness due to a lack of information, knowledge, or experience. Rather, what make a behavior a routine violation, is that it is a recurring workaround of the rules, not a recurring error. They are also normative and tolerated until someone gets hurt. They tend to be more motivation driven than errors that are more perceptually, attention or cognitively driven types of actions.</p><p>Consider for example, an individual who routinely drives 5 to 10 miles per hour over the speed limit. Indeed, such violations are not rare events. If we&#x27;re being honest, most of us likely do this all the time, and we are not the only ones. Many other drivers on the road are doing the same thing.  Furthermore, some of us may recall instances when we&#x27;ve actually driven past a police officer while exceeding the speed limit, but were not pulled over or given a ticket. As a result, we&#x27;ve come to believe that such bending of the rules are typically going to be tolerated by authority, and that minor infractions are not going to be enforced.  So, as would be expected, we continue on with such behavior.</p><p>Within an occupational environment, this might equate to workers routinely not wearing personal protective equipment,  or using safety harnesses. Even though the supervisor knows this is happening, little if anything gets done to correct the behavior. Not until someone gets hurt, does anyone really make a fuss over workers not being compliant with the rules.Or, consider airline pilots who consistently continue with an un-stabilized approach while landing, rather than implementing the go-around procedure, even though they risk landing too high, too fast, out of alignment with the runway centerline, or otherwise being unprepared. Although the airline’s management knows that this is happening, they do little to address the problem, because passengers are happy that their arrival was not delayed, by the pilots having to go around and attempt a second landing.  Again, not until an accident or incident happens, does leadership at the airline take action and begin addressing the reasons why this is repeatedly happening.</p><p>In summary, routine violations are actions that are characteristic or reflect typical behavior of an individual, are commonly performed by others in the work unit, in other words, they are normative behavior, and generally tolerated by supervisors until something bad happens. Ultimately, these behaviors can take on many forms, such as short cuts, inappropriate use of tools and equipment, or a general disregard for orders and procedures.</p><p><strong>Exceptional Violations (EV):</strong> Unlike routine violations, exceptional violations are isolated departures from authority, not necessarily indicative of an individual’s typical behavior pattern, or the behavior of others in the work unit, nor are such violations generally condoned or tolerated by management. </p><p>For example, an isolated instance of driving 105 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour speed zone would be considered an exceptional violation, since it is highly unlikely that the individual does this all the time nor do other drivers typically do it. Furthermore, we know that if we are caught driving at such an excessive speed, we are sure to get a ticket, or maybe even have our driving privileges suspended or revoked. Likewise, flying under a bridge, or engaging in other prohibited maneuvers, like low-level canyon running, would be considered an exceptional violation. Clearly, such behavior is not common among pilots, nor is it likely to be considered acceptable behavior by any standard.</p><p>However, it is important to note that while most exceptional violations are heinous, they are not considered “exceptional” because of their extreme nature. Rather, they are considered exceptional because they are neither typical behavior of the individual or others in the work unit, nor are they condoned by authority. Even seemingly benign behavior, such as entering a building through the exit door, double parking, dropping a candy wrapper but not picking it up, or borrowing someone’s cell phone without asking them, might all be considered exceptional violations, if they are not something that the individual does on a routine basis. </p><p>Nevertheless, most exceptional violations that lead to accidents and injuries, tend to be of the more extreme nature. These include such things as performing activities that an individual is not qualified to perform, exhibiting disruptive or destructive behavior in the workplace, or engaging in disruptive or destructive behavior, or isolated behaviors of extreme risk taking.</p><p><strong>II. PRECONDITIONS FOR UNSAFE ACTS: </strong>Background conditions setting the stage for unsafe acts. Consists of (1) Individual Factors, (2) Situational Factors, and (3) Social Factors</p><p><strong>1. Individual Factors</strong> (formerly &quot;Condition of the Operator&quot;):</p><p><strong>Mental States (MS):</strong> Refers to the transient psychological condition of an individual that negatively affects performance. Factors include cognitive issues such attention/distraction, memory failures, inaccurate expectations, lack of situation awareness etc. It also refers to the emotional conditions of an individual, such as their level of motivation, haste, complacency, frustration, boredom, as well as issues of mental arousal such as mental fatigue and drowsiness.</p><p><strong>Physiological States (PS): </strong>This category concerns the transient physical and physiological condition of an individual. Factors could include acute health issues such as illness, dehydration, or other physical ailments. Issues also include physical fatigue, as well as physiological fatigue due to circadian dysrhythmia. </p><p><strong>Physical/Mental Predispositions (PMP): </strong>Involves semi-permanent or enduring characteristics that might impact an individual&#x27;s ability to perform certain tasks, like physical disabilities or lack of experience. Examples: An employee with a recent injury struggling with tasks that require heavy lifting, potentially causing further injury or accidents. A new hire with limited experience in a high-risk job, leading to errors due to lack of familiarity with procedures.</p><p><strong>2. Situational Factors</strong></p><p><strong>Environmental Factors: (ENV) </strong>Refers to the immediate physical  and ambient surroundings in which the individual works, including factors like lighting, noise, and workspace layout. Examples: An office worker in a poorly lit environment, leading to eye strain and increased risk of making errors on critical documents</p><p><strong>Tools and Technology (TT):</strong> refers to the materials, software, and documents that individuals and teams utilize to perform their work. Examples include two main issues: Inadequate Design: This includes tools or technology that are confusing, cumbersome, inflexible, or incompatible. Such designs can hinder efficient and safe work practices, leading to increased risk of errors or accidents. Inadequate Condition: This pertains to tools or technology that are outdated, poorly maintained, or malfunctioning. Equipment in poor condition can fail to perform as expected, which can compromise safety and effectiveness in the workplace.</p><p><strong>3. Social Factors</strong></p><p><strong>Team Dynamics (TD): </strong>Formerly &quot;Communication, Coordination, and Planning&quot;: This sub-category refers to teamwork and team factors and to the interrelationship among team members including camaraderie and competition. It includes issues such as - Failure to provide/request information: This could be an instance where a team member fails to share critical safety information with the rest of the team, leading to uninformed decisions. Failure to confirm information: An example here might be a situation where a supervisor doesn’t verify that a safety protocol is understood by all team members, resulting in miscommunication. Inadequate planning by the team (not supervisory planning): This could involve a scenario where a team leader fails to plan and communicate adequately issues associated with a high-risk operation, leading to confusion and potential safety risks.</p><p><strong>Off-Duty Issues (ODI): </strong>Formerly &quot;Fitness for Duty (FD)&quot;: This  category addresses activities performed outside of work that can influence an individual’s ability to perform their job safely. Also called &quot;off duty issues.&quot; This category includes  - Poor Dietary/Health Practices: This refers to lifestyle choices that can negatively impact an individual&#x27;s work performance. Examples include consuming too much alcohol, not maintaining a healthy weight, or engaging in too little exercise. For instance, an employee who regularly consumes alcohol excessively may come to work with a hangover, affecting their concentration and decision-making abilities. Failure to Get Adequate Rest: This encompasses situations where individuals do not receive sufficient rest, which can be due to various reasons such as working a second job, limiting sleep, or physical overexertion. An example of this could be a worker who has a second job and therefore doesn&#x27;t get enough sleep, leading to fatigue and decreased alertness during their primary job, potentially increasing the risk of errors or accidents.</p><p><strong>III. SUPERVISORY FACTORS: </strong>This category in the HFACS framework addresses the critical role of supervision and management in maintaining safety and preventing accidents. The focus is on how supervisory actions or inactions can either contribute to or mitigate unsafe conditions and acts. This level has four categories (1) Engagement, (2) Planning, (3) Problem Correction, and (4) Integrity.</p><p><strong>Engagement (SE): </strong>Formerly called &quot;inadequate supervision&quot;, this category includes failing to provide proper guidance, oversight, or instruction. For example, a factory floor supervisor not regularly checking on workers to ensure they are following safety protocols. Not properly training employees in safety procedures or emergency responses. Failure to provide adequate guidance – inadequate mentoring/coaching, failure to communicate policies, procedures, performance expectations Failed to provide adequate oversight – inadequate monitoring of work activities, lack of presence within the work environment, failure to stay engaged with the workforce Failed to provide adequate training – inadequate instruction/education, failure to ensure staff qualifications, currency, training.</p><p><strong>Planning (SP): </strong>Formerly called &quot;planned inappropriate operations,&quot; refers to the performance of basic supervisory activities associated with work assignment and project planning. Such issues include Inadequate staffing/scheduling – failure to ensure enough staff are available, requiring staff to work excessive overtime or unreasonable shift rotations; also included is Inadequate workload assignment – failure to match staff competency with tasks, assigning unreasonable workload or tempo.</p><p><strong>Problem Correct (SPC):</strong> Formerly, &#x27;failed to correct known problem&quot;, this category entails supervisors being aware of problems but failing to take corrective action. This could include ignoring reports of malfunctioning equipment or repeatedly overlooking safety violations. Not addressing known hazards or performance deviations/violations that have been reported by employees or identified in safety inspections.</p><p><strong>Integrity (SI): </strong>Formerly &quot;supervisory violations&quot; this category involves supervisors themselves engaging in unsafe practices or violating rules or instructing others to do the same. An example could be a team leader in a chemical plant disregarding safety protocols during an experiment, or encouraging or implicitly condoning rule-breaking among subordinates to achieve operational targets.</p><p><strong>IV. ORGANIZATINOAL INFLUENCES: </strong>This category in the HFACS framework deals with the broader organizational context and its impact on safety and operations. It focuses on how organizational (1) culture, (2) Process, and (3) Resource Management practices can either contribute to supervisory factors or unsafe conditions and practices.</p><p><strong>1. Organizational Culture (OC): </strong> Refers to a variety of issues including organizational values prioritize revenue or productivity over safety, leading to a culture where safety concerns are secondary. For example, the organization&#x27;s commitment to safety is only at a compliance level, without proactive safety initiatives, or the company lacks openness about safety issues, where adverse events are concealed, and lessons learned from incidents are not shared organization wide. </p><p><strong>2. Operational Process (OP): </strong>In the HFACS framework, &quot;Operational Process&quot; under Organizational Influences focuses on how an organization plans and executes its objectives, crucial for safety and efficiency: Topics involving strategic planning, such as issues that arise from conflicting priorities or unrealistic goals, as well as problems with policies and procedures that are conflicting or unclear. Other issues associated with this category include leadership oversight, including engagement and understanding of operational risks associated with the way the organization does business. </p><p><strong>3. Resource Management (RM): </strong>Refers to the support provided by senior leadership to accomplish the objectives of the organization, including the allocation of human, equipment/facility, and monetary resources. Issues include problems in practices in hiring and retaining qualified personnel and acquiring the necessary equipment/technology for performing safe operations. Also included are budgetary constraints, excessive cost cutting, unfunded mandates that impacts supervisors&#x27; ability to manage preconditions.</p><p><strong>Individual HFACS Causal and Contributing Factor Descriptions </strong></p><p><strong>How to write INDIVIDUAL causal and contributing factor (</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>CCF</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>) descriptions</strong></p><p>When extracting HFACS variables from documents, you need to express each “hole in the cheese” explicitly, so people are not confused about what you mean, without coding it with a label. You want to give the reader as much information as possible in a single active sentence to understand the meaning of the sentence (the individual hole) without having to infer any subtext. The reader should be able trust that meaning of the sentence is clear and that neither knowledge of the event nor understanding of subtext is required. </p><p><strong>General Rules for an Individual Writing </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>CCFs</strong></p><p>NEVER use HFACS code labels when a writing individual iCCFs.</p><p>ALWAYS write sentences using an active voice with a clear, explicit subject, verb, object (SVO) clause or subject, verb, complement (SVC) clause.</p><p>ALWAYS write sentence to have a singular topic, with only one idea and subject per sentence.</p><p><strong>Specific Examples</strong></p><p>1. Exceptional Violation</p><p><strong>Original:</strong> &quot;The resident administered the drug without verifying it as required due to the anesthesia technician&#x27;s insistence that it was atropine.&quot;</p><p><strong>Revised:</strong> &quot;Compelled by the anesthesia technician&#x27;s confident assurance and pressure, the resident made a rare decision to bypass the standard verification process, administering the drug without the usual checks.&quot;</p><p><strong>Revised Grammatical Changes:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction of a Participial Phrase:</strong> &quot;Compelled by the anesthesia technician&#x27;s confident assurance and under unusual pressure,&quot; serves to set the context and mood before stating the main action. This addition gives a reason for the resident&#x27;s behavior, emphasizing the exceptional circumstances.</p><p><strong>Use of a Past Participle: </strong>&quot;made a rare decision to bypass&quot; replaces the simpler past tense &quot;administered&quot; to highlight the deliberateness and rarity of the action.</p><p><strong>Adding Contextual Modifiers:</strong> Terms like &quot;rare decision&quot; and &quot;under unusual pressure&quot; were used to stress the exceptional nature of the violation, which is not part of the resident&#x27;s normal behavior.</p><p><strong>Detailing the Action:</strong> Expanding on &quot;without verifying it&quot; to &quot;bypassing the standard verification process, administering the drug without the usual checks&quot; provides more explicit detail about what the resident did wrong, emphasizing the deviation from standard procedures.</p><p>2: Routine Violation</p><p><strong>Original:</strong> &quot;The anesthesia technician provided the resident an unlabeled syringe, breaching medication labeling standards.&quot;</p><p><strong>Revised:</strong> &quot;The anesthesia technician, following a practice not uncommon in their workflow, provided the resident with an unlabeled syringe, sidestepping the formal medication labeling standards.&quot;</p><p><strong>Revised Grammatical Changes:</strong></p><p><strong>Incorporation of an Introductory Clause</strong>: &quot;Following a practice not uncommon in their workflow,&quot; introduces the idea that the action is part of a pattern of behavior, without directly stating it as routine. This clause sets the stage for understanding the technician&#x27;s actions within the context of their work habits.</p><p><strong>Subtle Language Choice</strong>: &quot;Sidestepping the formal medication labeling standards&quot; replaces &quot;breaching medication labeling standards&quot; to imply a less direct defiance of the rules, which aligns with the notion of routine violation being more about cutting corners than outright breaking rules.</p><p><strong>Use of Commas for Clauses</strong>: Commas were used to separate the introductory clause from the main action, which helps to emphasize the context of the action as a separate piece of information that informs the reader about the nature of the violation.</p><p>3. Avoiding Compound Causal Factors</p><p><strong>The original sentence: </strong>&quot;The anesthesia technician incorrectly prepared the wrong medication by inadvertently substituting phenylephrine for atropine.&quot; </p><p>This sentence combines two distinct actions into a single event: the technician&#x27;s non-adherence to established rules during the preparation process, and the accidental substitution of one medication for another. To clarify the distinct nature of these actions within the HFACS framework, the sentence should divided into two parts, each emphasizing a different aspect of the event:</p><p><strong>Routine Violation Component:</strong></p><p><strong>New Sentence:</strong> &quot;Following a commonly overlooked practice within the department, the anesthesia technician, once again, prepared the medication without consulting the correct labeling guidelines.&quot;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This revised statement underscores the habitual nature of the technician&#x27;s behavior by indicating it&#x27;s a &quot;commonly overlooked practice within the department&quot; and uses &quot;once again&quot; to suggest repetition. By doing so, it clarifies that the action is part of a pattern of behavior (RV), rather than an isolated incident (EV). This adjustment aims to remove any ambiguity that could lead to misclassification as an Exceptional Violation, focusing on the habitual aspect and organizational tolerance implicit in Routine Violations.</p><p>By explicitly stating the behavior as a recurring practice that is overlooked within the department, the revised statement emphasizes the systemic nature of the violation, aligning it more clearly with the definition of a Routine Violation and avoiding potential confusion with the criteria for Exceptional Violations.</p><p><strong>Skill-based Error Component:</strong></p><p><strong>New Sentence:</strong> &quot;During this process, the technician, due to a lapse in attention, mistakenly confused phenylephrine with atropine.&quot;</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This part of the narrative points out the inadvertent error—the actual confusion of two medications—characterizing it as a Skill-based Error. The emphasis here is on the unintentional nature of the mistake, arising from a momentary lapse in attention or a misunderstanding in the execution of a task, rather than a deliberate action.</p><p>In dividing the original sentence into these two new sentences, the distinction becomes clear: the first sentence addresses a behavioral issue of routine non-compliance with safety protocols (Routine Violation), while the second sentence focuses on the unintentional operational mistake made during medication preparation (Skill-based Error). This separation allows for a more nuanced analysis and categorization of the incident, aligning each part with specific elements of the HFACS framework for a clearer understanding of the underlying factors contributing to the event.</p><p><strong>HFACS Coding Guidelines and Examples</strong></p><p><strong>Direct Causal Factor Identification</strong>: When coding causal factors from statements, focus solely on the explicit causal factors described. Avoid extending the analysis to implied or inferred factors not directly stated. Concentrate on the causal relationship as presented in the statement, ensuring that the coding reflects the explicit linkage between cause and effect.</p><p><strong>Avoid Assumptions</strong>: Coders should not make assumptions about the causal factors based on subtext or potential underlying issues not explicitly mentioned. If a causal factor statement does not directly attribute the cause to a specific action, condition, or decision, it should not be inferred. This approach ensures that the coding remains anchored to the information provided without introducing bias or speculation.</p><p><strong>Questioning Implicit Causal Relationships:</strong> Encourage coders to critically evaluate any implied causal relationships within the statements. If a causal factor seems to be suggested rather than explicitly stated, coders should recognize this as beyond the immediate scope of their coding task. The emphasis should be on the causal factors that are directly linked to the outcome in the statement, rather than on drawing conclusions from what might be implied or suggested.</p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p>The frustration caused by the poor design of the electronic health record led the clinician to manually override the warning.</p><p>Correct: Code the sentence as Mental State based on the subject in the SVO clause - &quot;The frustration&quot; </p><p>Incorrect: Code sentence as Tools and Technology, based on subordinate clause - &quot;caused by the poor design of the electronic health record.&quot; </p><p>Incorrect: Code the sentence as a violation based on the subordinate clause -&quot;to manually override the warning.&quot;</p><p>The poor design of the electronic health record caused the clinician to feel frustration, leading him to manually override the warning.</p><p>Correct: Code the sentence as Tools and Technology, based on the subject of the SVO clause: &quot;The poor design of the electronic health record&quot;</p><p>Incorrect: Code the sentence as Mental State, based on the object of the sentence - &quot;feel frustration&quot;</p><p>Incorrect: Code the sentence as a violation, based on the participial phrase - &quot;leading him to manually override the warning&quot;</p><p>Frustrated by the design of the electronic health record, the clinician manually overrode the warning.</p><p>Correct: Code the sentence as a violation based on the entire SVO clause &quot;the clinician manually overrode&quot;</p><p>Incorrect: Code the sentence as mental state based on the participial phrase - &quot;Frustrated&quot; by the design of the electronic health record (modifies &quot;the clinician&quot; and provides a reason for the action)</p><p>Incorrect: Code the sentence as Tools and Technology based on the participial phrase - &quot;by the design of the electronic health record&quot; </p><p>Due to the poor design of the electronic health record, the clinician became frustrated causing him to manually override the warning.</p><p>Correct: Code the sentence as a mental state based on the complement -&quot;frustrated&quot;</p><p>Incorrect: Code the sentence as Tools and Technology based on the adverbial phrase - &quot;Due to the poor design of the electronic health record&quot; </p><p>Incorrect: Code the sentence as a violation based on the participial phrase - &quot;causing him to manually override the warning&quot;</p><p><strong>5. </strong> The hospital&#x27;s purchase of an outdated technology increased the risk of information being missed or misunderstood.</p><p>Correct: Resource Management</p><p>Incorrect: Tools and Technology</p><p>6.  The designers and implementers of the hardware and software did not fully address fail-safe requirements, such as the confirmation of transfer of responsibility and message receipt.</p><p>Correct: Operational Process</p><p>Incorrect: Tools and Technology</p><p>7. The accepting nurse failed to confirm patient assignments, leading to the missed care of a patient.</p><p>Correct: Team Dynamics</p><p>Incorrect: Supervisory Planning, since the nurse is not stated to be serving a supervisory role.</p><p>8. &quot;Compelled by the anesthesia technician&#x27;s confident assurance and pressure, the resident made a rare decision to bypass the standard verification process, administering the drug without the usual checks.&quot;</p><p>Correct: Exceptional violation based on &quot;rare decision&quot;</p><p>Incorrect: Code the sentence as Team Dynamics (TD). The technician&#x27;s insistence, while influencing the resident&#x27;s decision, does not shift the grammatical subject of the sentence to reflect a team dynamic; it remains an external factor influencing an individual&#x27;s decision rather than an interaction or decision made by a collective entity. Team Dynamics would require the subject of the sentence to reflect a collective or interaction (e.g., &quot;the team,&quot; &quot;the resident and the technician,&quot; or a similar grouping), emphasizing the dynamics or interactions between team members affecting the outcome.</p><p>9. Following the common practice within their team, the anesthesia technician prepared medication in an unlabeled 2 mL syringe, omitting the step of verifying the original ampule as is often the case.”</p><p>correct: Team Dynamics (TD)</p><p>incorrect: Tools and Technology (TT)</p><p>From a grammatical standpoint, the reason the scenario is not categorized under “Tools and Technology” but rather as a “Routine Violation” focuses on the subject and the verb of the sentence, which highlight the technician’s actions rather than the tools or technology themselves.</p><p>In the sentence, “The anesthesia technician, again prepared medication in an unlabeled 2 mL syringe, bypassing the step to verify the original ampule,” the subject is “The anesthesia technician,” and the main verbs related to the action are “prepared” and “bypassing.” This grammatical structure places the emphasis on the actions taken by the technician rather than on the tools (the unlabeled 2 mL syringe and the original ampule) used in the process.</p><p>The use of “prepared” and “bypassing” as the main verbs focuses on the behavior and decision-making process of the technician, indicating a deliberate choice to not follow the verification procedure, which aligns with the definition of a Routine Violation—a willful deviation from established protocols.</p><p>If the sentence were to emphasize issues with the tools or technology, such as a malfunctioning labeling device or inherently confusing design leading to the error, the grammatical structure would likely highlight the tools or technology as the subject or main focus of the sentence. For example, “The design of the unlabeled 2 mL syringe and ampule system led to a verification error by the anesthesia technician” would shift the emphasis onto the tools and technology, making it more appropriate for that category.</p><p>Therefore, based on the grammar of the sentence, the focus is on the technician’s actions, not the inadequacies of the tools or technology, supporting the classification as a Routine Violation.</p><p>4.

Think of as many different ways you can say “cause”...Resulted in, As a result, Lead to, Fostered, Perpetuated, Exacerbated, Impeded, Impacted, Effected, Due to, Because, Consequently, etc.</p><p>Use these synonyms (and others) to keep your statements from being redundant or sounding awkward.</p><p><strong>HFACS Pathway / CCF TABLE</strong></p><p>Example:</p><p><strong>Guidelines for Conducting an HFACS Interview</strong></p><p><strong>About the questions listed in this guide</strong></p><p>This guide contains questions to help you conduct a witness interview. Using this HFACS-RCA interviewing guide will ensure that you consider “areas of inquiry that might otherwise be missed.”1</p><p>The questions are organized around the HFACS-RCA framework to help you structure your interview. Note that there are no direct questions pertaining to unsafe acts. There are several reasons for this. First, you will likely already know about some of the unsafe acts as a result of completing your initial investigation activities. Second, direct questions about what people did wrong often appear confrontational, which is something you want to avoid. Finally, for any given event, there can be multiple unsafe acts that were committed by more than one individual. Discussing each of these would not be productive. </p><p>By asking the types of questions provided in this guide, you will be able to better understand the underlying human factors that preceded a given unsafe act and will be better able to determine later in your analysis the type of unsafe acts that were committed. </p><p><strong>How to ask Questions</strong></p><p>The interview should be a conversation not an interrogation. Try to ask opened ended questions and let the witness do most of the talking. Some of the questions listed in this guide may seem redundant because they are related to more than one human factors issue, but there is no need to ask these questions twice. Asking similar questions in different ways allows you to glean additional information about the topic. </p><p>In the end, use your best judgement when deciding which questions to ask. You do not have to ask every question and you may have to reword some questions to make them relevant to the event you are investigating. You are also encouraged to come up with questions of your own as the list of questions in this guide was not meant to be exhaustive.</p><p><strong>Who To Interview</strong></p><p>There are several people you may want to talk to in order to gather information about the event. These people vary in terms of their involvement or knowledge about what happened. The purpose for interviewing these individuals also varies. Therefore, the type of questions that you ask needs to be tailored to the specific individuals you are talking to and should be based on the type of information that you hope to glean from the conversation. Below is a list of some possible witnesses who you may want to interview.</p><p><strong>Participant witness </strong>– These individuals were directly involved in the event. They may include staff as well as others who directly witnessed the event.</p><p><strong>Eye witness</strong>– These are individuals who were not directly involved in the event but may have seen or heard the event taking place. They may include co-workers or colleagues present at the time the event took place.</p><p><strong>Expert/Organizational witness </strong>–These are witnesses who were not involved in the event but they may have pertinent knowledge about factors associated with the event. Such individuals may be device manufacturers, supervisors or administrators.</p><p><strong>SAMPLE HFACS QUESTIONS </strong></p><p><strong>Unsafe Acts: </strong>Direct questions regarding specific actions should be avoided, to reduce the sense of interrogation.
