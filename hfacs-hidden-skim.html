    <p><strong>The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) </strong></p><p><strong>Core Components of HFACS</strong></p><p><strong>I. UNSAFE ACTS: </strong>This level refers to an individual&#x27;s actions that deviate from a generally recognized method of performing a task. Ultimately, it is these unsafe acts that increase the likelihood of an adverse event occurring. Stated more simply, unsafe acts are those things that people do or don’t do, that increase the risk of something bad happening. They consist of (1) Errors - Decision, Skill-based, and Perceptual and (2) Violations - Routine and Exceptional</p><p><strong>1.</strong><strong>ERRORS</strong> - Errors refer to activities that occur within the prescribed norms of a given situation, yet the actions do not achieve the intended outcome. More plainly, errors are instances where an individual is attempting to do the right thing, but actually does the wrong thing instead. Or, when someone chooses to do the right thing, but ends up doing it the wrong way. In either case, the person’s intention is to perform the task the way it is supposed to be done, but it simply does not work out. As a result, we say that they’ve made an error. </p><p><strong>Decision Errors (DE):</strong> These so-called thinking errors, represent the conscious actions, or inaction by individuals whose hearts are in the right place, yet the plan itself proves inadequate or inappropriate for the situation. As a result, the outcome is typically less than what we hoped for. Typically, these decision errors can take the form of inadequate information gathering, poor situation assessment, or inadequate response selection. (Note that decisions regarding taking excessive risks, pushing the envelope, or working around rules, are a unique type of decision issue in HFACS, called violations. These do not belong to the category of Decision Errors. Rather, the belong elsewhere in under violations, which are discussed later.)</p><p><strong>Revised:</strong> &quot;Compelled by the anesthesia technician&#x27;s confident assurance and pressure, the resident made a rare decision to bypass the standard verification process, administering the drug without the usual checks.&quot;</p><p><strong>Revised Grammatical Changes:</strong></p><p><strong>Introduction of a Participial Phrase:</strong> &quot;Compelled by the anesthesia technician&#x27;s confident assurance and under unusual pressure,&quot; serves to set the context and mood before stating the main action. This addition gives a reason for the resident&#x27;s behavior, emphasizing the exceptional circumstances.</p><p><strong>Use of a Past Participle: </strong>&quot;made a rare decision to bypass&quot; replaces the simpler past tense &quot;administered&quot; to highlight the deliberateness and rarity of the action.</p><p><strong>Adding Contextual Modifiers:</strong> Terms like &quot;rare decision&quot; and &quot;under unusual pressure&quot; were used to stress the exceptional nature of the violation, which is not part of the resident&#x27;s normal behavior.</p><p>Incorrect: Tools and Technology</p><p>7. The accepting nurse failed to confirm patient assignments, leading to the missed care of a patient.</p><p>Correct: Team Dynamics</p><p>Incorrect: Supervisory Planning, since the nurse is not stated to be serving a supervisory role.</p><p>8. &quot;Compelled by the anesthesia technician&#x27;s confident assurance and pressure, the resident made a rare decision to bypass the standard verification process, administering the drug without the usual checks.&quot;</p><p>The questions are organized around the HFACS-RCA framework to help you structure your interview. Note that there are no direct questions pertaining to unsafe acts. There are several reasons for this. First, you will likely already know about some of the unsafe acts as a result of completing your initial investigation activities. Second, direct questions about what people did wrong often appear confrontational, which is something you want to avoid. Finally, for any given event, there can be multiple unsafe acts that were committed by more than one individual. Discussing each of these would not be productive. </p><p>By asking the types of questions provided in this guide, you will be able to better understand the underlying human factors that preceded a given unsafe act and will be better able to determine later in your analysis the type of unsafe acts that were committed. </p><p><strong>How to ask Questions</strong></p><p>The interview should be a conversation not an interrogation. Try to ask opened ended questions and let the witness do most of the talking. Some of the questions listed in this guide may seem redundant because they are related to more than one human factors issue, but there is no need to ask these questions twice. Asking similar questions in different ways allows you to glean additional information about the topic. </p><p>In the end, use your best judgement when deciding which questions to ask. You do not have to ask every question and you may have to reword some questions to make them relevant to the event you are investigating. You are also encouraged to come up with questions of your own as the list of questions in this guide was not meant to be exhaustive.</p>
